Findings, guesses, assumptions:

Findings:
Trio is said to be working at 24 bit @ 44.100 Hz - however I found the recorded mono audio signals to be 16 bit @ 44.100 Hz.
I have loaded the whole .tsld file into audacity (http://www.audacityteam.org/) and tried various combinations until
the audio signal sounded fine.

Trio+ works strictly on a 32 k (32768 bytes) chunks basis. 
Audio is recorded in these chunks, starting at 170800 bytes offset from file start.
In case no overdubs are made, audio comes interleaved with constant 32k chunks of null bytes.
These null byte chunks are overwritten with the overdub plus the material from the initial audio chunks.
Audio then starts at 138032 bytes offset from file start, lasts for 32 k then comes 32 k audio of the initial
recording followed by 32 k from the overdub and so on.

So everything from 138032 bytes on is audio in some interleaved format.

ALL INFORMATION ON THE ADDRESSES ARE WITHIN THE 'Trio+Addresses.xlsx' - HAVE A LOOK AND CONTRIBUTE !!!

Ah, and no: standard midi information is NOT within the header (in terms of messages according to the midi specs).


Assumptions:
Digitech did not re-invent the wheel! They will rely on some form of MIDI representation for the bass and drums.
However it might be possible that all bass and drum parts are called from an device-internal list of some sorts of presets.
If that was the case, we would be unlucky in trying to get MIDI out of the file.
Besides MIDI, there has to be other things stored like the type of bass and drums (i.e. drumkit / type of bass) and song structure.

There is STILL a lot to be found out!
