Findings, guesses, assumptions:

Findings:
Trio is said to be working at 24 bit @ 44.100 Hz - however I found the recorded mono audio signals to be 32 bit @ 22.050 Hz.
I have loaded the whole .tsld file into audacity (http://www.audacityteam.org/) and tried various combinations until the audio signal sounded fine.

All audio starts at 170800 bytes. I did not found any other (i.e. MIDI) data from that point on.

Audio comes interleaved with constant 32k chunks (32768 bytes) of null bytes.

Guesses:
All data from 0...170799 might be MIDI in some form.

Assumptions:
Digitech did not re-invent the wheel! They will rely on some form of MIDI representation for the bass and drums.
However it might be possible that all bass and drum parts are called from an device-internal list of some sorts of presets.
If that was the case, we would be unlucky in trying to get MIDI out of the file.
Besides MIDI, there has to be other things stored like the type of bass and drums (i.e. drumkit / type of bass) and song structure.
There is a lot to be found out!
